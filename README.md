# Microbiome

This repository is for files, information and code associated with the Aquatic and Riparian Macroinvertebrate Microbiome project run by Elise Millar and Dr. Karen Kidd (McMaster University). This project was a field study with samples collected from the Grand River at sites upstream and downstream of the Kitchener and Waterloo wastewater treatment plants (Ontario, Canada). The digestive gland (mussels) or whole-body (spiders) or ethanol-rinsed whole-body (invertebrates) was collected for microbiome analyses. Extraction and sequencing was completed in the lab of Dr. Mike Surette and the Farncombe Institute (McMaster University). Field sampling was done in collaboration and with the support of Dr. Patty Gillis' lab (Environment and Climate Change Canada) and Dr. Mark Servos' lab (University of Waterloo).

# Invertebrates Samples

R code included in the file "Invertebrates" was used to analyze 16S rRNA bacterial sequences from invertebrates (spiders, mussels, aquatic insects) collected upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants on the Grand River. Fastq sequences and metadata associated with this projected have been uploaded to NCBI and will be linked here upon publication. Files required to run this code are marked with a star and additional files associated with this project are listed:
-* metadata: map_file_fall_2018_NEWER.txt
-* assigned taxonomy: taxa_KKfish_silva132.csv
-* sequences: seqtab_nochim_transposed_KKfish_v34.csv
-R code comparing water quality measures to bacterial abundance: WaterQuality_fall_RDA_PCOAcoloured.RMD

# Water Filters

R code included in the file "Water Filters" was used to analyze 16S rRNA bacterial sequences from water filters collected upstream and downstream of wastewater treatment plants on the Grand River. Fastq sequences and metadata associated with this projected have been uploaded to NCBI and will be linked here upon publication. Files required to run this code are marked with a star:
-* metadata: WaterFiltersMetadata.txt
-* assigned taxonomy: taxa_VRwater_silva132.csv
-* sequences: seqtab_nochim_transposed_VRwater_v34.csv
