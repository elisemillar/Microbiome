# Microbiome

This repository is for files, information and code associated with the Aquatic and Riparian Macroinvertebrate Microbiome project run by Elise Millar and Dr. Karen Kidd (McMaster University). This project was a field study with samples collected from the Grand River at sites upstream and downstream of the Kitchener and Waterloo wastewater treatment plants (Ontario, Canada). The digestive gland (mussels) or whole-body (spiders) or ethanol-rinsed whole-body (invertebrates) was collected for microbiome analyses. Extraction and sequencing was completed in the lab of Dr. Mike Surette and the Farncombe Institute (McMaster University). Field sampling was done in collaboration and with the support of Dr. Patty Gillis' lab (Environment and Climate Change Canada) and Dr. Mark Servos' lab (University of Waterloo).
